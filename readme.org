#+TITLE:	Org Orchestrate
#+startup:	showeverything

Create nodes in AWS with Org mode (this is a proof of concept...)

*** Usage

For example having a document ~cloud.org~ like:

#+BEGIN_SRC conf
,#+title: Set up an Ubuntu 14.04 node in AWS

,*** Credentials

For connecting to AWS:

,#+aws_access_key: your-aws-access-key
,#+aws_secret_key: your-aws-secret-key
,#+aws_region: us-east-1

For executing blocks remotely via SSH:

,#+sshidentityfile: keys/identity.pem

,*** Example server

,#+name:   create-ubuntu-14-04-node
,#+header: :ami ami-408c7f28
,#+header: :key_name aws-keyname
,#+header: :instance_type t1.micro
,#+header: :security_group sg-fddc2490
,#+BEGIN_SRC sh :results output :user ubuntu
sudo apt-get update
echo "Done!"
,#+END_SRC
#+END_SRC

Would describe how to spin up a single node in AWS with those details:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh 
org-orchestrate -f org/examples/cloud.org
#+END_SRC

Results:
